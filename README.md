## Description

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a software engineer. It serves as a professional introduction, highlighting my expertise in various technologies and the projects I have worked on. The website includes sections such as "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact," providing a comprehensive overview of my career and technical abilities.

The portfolio is built using modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to ensure a responsive, visually appealing, and highly functional user experience. It also features smooth navigation, clean design, and a dark-light mode toggle to enhance usability.


## Technologies

This portfolio utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development with better tooling and fewer runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with a focus on customization and responsiveness.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that offers fast performance and optimized development workflows.
- **GitHub Pages**: A hosting service to deploy the portfolio, ensuring easy access and visibility.
- **Lucide React**: A collection of open-source icons, used to enhance the user interface with clean, scalable vector icons.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A UI component library that provides pre-designed, customizable components to streamline the development process and improve the visual quality of the website.
